        <p id="IntroParagraph">Hi there! If you're reading this, you probably go to school (or have in the past) and have access to a computer. 
            But have you ever thought about all of the kids in third-world countries who don't have access to any sort of schooling?
            The next Albert Einstein could be out there somewhere and have no clue how bright he/she is simply because of their lack of education.
         That's why it's so important to take advantage of the resources we have and use them to communicate with kids in other parts of the world 
         who aren't as fortunate as we are. Education is an integral part of living a rewarding life, and spreading awareness about this topic
        can help millions of kids worldwide who aren't as fortunate as we are.</p>
         <p id="IntroParagraph">Here, I believe that you can do anything if you know how to read and write. Join me in a mission to give 
             everybody an education!</p>
